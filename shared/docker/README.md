# Docker Integration
### About
This directory contains integrations/implementations using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).  For those that don't know, Docker is a piece of software used to Build, Ship, and Deploy distributed applications and services at any scale using `containers`.

### How does it work?
Docker is a container engine, which leverages the Linux kernel to use cgroups and namespaces for controlling applications deployed and build on top the the host operating system.  Docker is also used to automate, build, and deploy container application quickly and efficiently, while also reducing time spent on patching, installing dependencies, and managing hundreds/thousands of server restarts across the environment.  Docker helps create lightweight applications and images that can be custom made to include only the bare essentials.
